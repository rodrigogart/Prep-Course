        <h2>Why am I studying Web Development?</h2>
        <p>When I was in College studying Actuarial Sciences, I always found coding challenging.<br>
            I struggled organizing my ideas and giving structure to the model I was working on. So, I decided to face the monster of programming and took this challenge as a way to 
            demonstrate to myself that its possible. <br>
            After I finish the course, I want to get my first Tech Job, work for an Insurtech Company and help to create solutions for this industry.</p>
